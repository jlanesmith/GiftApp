# GiftApp

GiftApp is a text-based application that allows you to write out a wishlist and allows your friends/family to see your wishlist and assign themselves to an item. Other friends/family will see both your list and who has assigned themselves to which items, and this prevents two people from buying the same item. You, however, can only see your list, without knowing who will buy you which items.

Multiple accounts can be created in GiftApp, allowing you to both create your own list and assign yourself to items on other people's lists.
